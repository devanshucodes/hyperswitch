Payment Flows
Discover how to process one-time and recurring payments, save payment methods, and more.
Save a payment method
Save customer payment methods securely for future transactions
Self Hosted?
Host Hyperswitch on-premise? Utilize our full API suite.
‚Äã
Environment
We have a testing environment referred to ‚Äúsandbox,‚Äù which you can set up to test API calls without affecting production data. You can sign up on our Dashboard to get API keys to access Hyperswitch API.
Use the following base URLs when making requests to the APIs:
Environment	Base URL
Sandbox	https://sandbox.hyperswitch.io
Production	https://api.hyperswitch.io
If you do not hold a PCI certification to collect and store card data on your servers, we recommend using Unified Checkout to accept card information from users.
‚Äã
Authentication and API keys
Hyperswitch authenticates your API requests using your account‚Äôs API keys. Each account has two API keys for authentication:
Key	Example	When to Use
Secret key (API-key)	snd_c69***	Used to authenticate API requests from your merchant server. Don‚Äôt expose this key on a website or embed it in a mobile application.
Publishable key	pk_snd_3b3***	Used to authenticate API requests from your app‚Äôs client. Can be publicly-accessible in your web or mobile app‚Äôs client-side code.

Postman Collection

Payment Status Lifecycle
Hyperswitch handles the complex functionality of a comprehensive payments flow through the Payments object that transitions through multiple states during its payments lifecycle. Given below are the various statuses a payment can have:
Payment Status	Description
requires_payment_method	Once you create a payment through payments/create endpoint with no payment method attached to it, the payments object transitions to ‚Äòrequires_payment_method‚Äô.
requires_confirmation	After attaching a payment method through payments/update endpoint, the payments object requires you to confirm the payment.
requires_customer_action	Once the payment is confirmed through payments/confirm endpoint, if additional authentication is required, the payments object transitions to this state.
requires_capture	If you want to do separate authorize and capture, setting capture field to ‚Äòmanual‚Äô during payments/create or confirm call will transition the payment object to this state after customer action succeeds.
processing	In case of automatic capture, the payments object transitions to processing state post confirm call and subsequent customer authentication if available.
succeeded	The payments object reaches success state post confirmation of successful processing from the payment processor.
failed	The payments object transitions to a failed state when the payment processor confirms the processing failure.
expired	You can expire the payments object while it is in any state except when it is under ‚Äòprocessing‚Äô or ‚Äòsucceeded‚Äô state.


‚Äã
Redirect URL
This is what a url looks like after redirection
https://app.hyperswitch.io?status=succeeded&payment_intent_client_secret=pay_NCv9vc19f8aa75OpFxH8_secret_V4zAc7V0C8WAw6FECMKM&amount=10000&manual_retry_allowed=false&signature=4fae0cfa775e4551db9356563d4b98b55662fe3c1c945fe215d90ccf3541282c535909ae901d82174d6b1e46ba1684aa0aa4c8861be0e2a9ef6f950a975d5014&signature_algorithm=HMAC-SHA512
The available parameters are as follows:
status - can have values of succeeded, processingand failed.
payment_intent_client_secret - This is the client secret associated with the payment. This can be used to retrieve the payment status from hyperswitch.
manual_retry_allowed - whether this payment can be retried or not.
signature - A HMAC signature of the payload, this can be verified using the payment_response_hash_key.
signature_algorithm - The HMAC algorithm used to calculate the signature.

Authentication Types

Copy page

Overview of authentication types and authorization keys available in Hyperswitch.

Hyperswitch supports multiple API key types, each designed for different authentication and authorization use cases.
For security, never expose secret or admin keys in client-side or mobile code. Use publishable keys for public contexts.
‚Äã
1. API Key (Secret Key)
Primary merchant authentication key for server-side API requests.
Environment-specific prefix (snd_, prod_, etc.).
Used for server to server requests.
This key can be generated and managed from the Hyperswitch dashboard (sandbox).
Never expose this key in public code.
‚Äã
2. Admin API Key
Administrative key with elevated privileges.
Used for system-level operations such as creating merchant and connector accounts.
Should only be used in secure, internal workflows.
Some API calls require an admin API key. Do not confuse this with a regular API Key.
The admin API key is a configuration value that can be set at the time of deploying the Hyperswitch server.
Admin API keys for the hosted Hyperswitch environments (sandbox/production) are managed by Juspay and are not provided publicly.
You do not generate this key from the dashboard.
Instead, set your Admin API Key in your deployment configuration:
For Docker Compose:
Update the value in your docker_compose.toml file:

Copy
# docker_compose.toml
admin_api_key = "your_admin_key_here"
For Helm Chart deployments: Set the admin API key in your values.yaml file.

Copy
# values.yaml
adminApiKey: your_admin_key_here
Do not expose your admin API key publicly. Only trusted entities and trusted applications should have access to this value.
Check the Docker Compose example for extra clarity: See example in the Hyperswitch repository
‚Äã
3. Publishable Key
Client-side key with limited permissions.
Safe for use in public client-side (web or mobile) code.
Prefix: pk_{environment}_{uuid}.
Generated during merchant account creation.
‚Äã
4. Ephemeral Key
Temporary key for limited operations.
Used for single or short-lived access (e.g., accessing a specific customer object).
Validity is configurable (see [eph_key] validity in development.toml).
‚Äã
5. JWT Key
JWT Bearer Token used for API authentication and session management.
Required for certain JWT-protected endpoints and user authentication flows.
Format: Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
‚Äã
When to Use
JWT tokens are primarily used by the Hyperswitch Control Center front end to authenticate API requests. You generally do not need to manage or use JWTs unless:
You‚Äôre building a custom front end that replaces the Control Center, or
You‚Äôre a developer testing APIs directly (e.g., using Postman or running the server without the UI).
For most users interacting through the Control Center UI, JWTs are handled automatically and do not need to be generated or included manually.
Note:
JWTs are not provisioned via the Hyperswitch dashboard.
They are typically issued during an authentication flow, such as during login or session creation.

Copy
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
Keep your JWT tokens secure. Do not expose them in client-side code unless specifically required for session management, and always use HTTPS when transmitting JWTs.

# Error Codes

Hyperswitch uses error codes, types, and messages to communicate errors during API calls. There are two main types of error codes: Error Codes and Unified Error Codes.

1. **Error Codes** refer to the error code sent by the connector.
2. **Unified Error Codes** refer to the generic error code sent by the Hyperswitch server, based on the connector's error code. Hyperswitch groups the different error codes from connectors into more generic Unified Error Codes for structured relay of PSP errors, helping merchants derive patterns and determine the next steps for ongoing transactions.

There are four types of Error Codes and five types of Unified Error Codes.

**1. Error Codes:**
The section below contains all the error codes and their corresponding error messages.

| Error Code | Type                  | Description                                                  |

# Rate Limits

The Hyperswitch API has multiple checks in place to enhance its stability when faced with sudden surges of incoming traffic. Merchants who send numerous requests in rapid succession could encounter error responses indicated by the status code 429.

<Warning>
  The default rate limit for all Hyperswitch APIs is **80 requests per second**.
  Reach out to [biz@hyperswitch.io](mailto:biz@hyperswitch.io) if you have a requirement for higher limits.
</Warning>

## How to handle rate limits

Effectively handling rate limit 429 errors is crucial for maintaining a seamless user experience.

* Implement retry mechanisms with progressively increasing intervals to avoid overwhelming the system with repeated requests.
* To proactively manage these errors, monitoring tools can help track usage patterns and provide insights for adjusting rate limits as necessary.
* Ultimately, a well-orchestrated strategy for managing 429 errors not only prevents disruption but also fosters positive user engagement by transparently addressing limitations and promoting responsible API usage.

## Understanding API locking

If you see a 429 error with the following error message, it is due to API locking and not due to rate limiting:

```text
At this moment, access to this object is restricted due to ongoing utilization by another API request or an ongoing Hyperswitch process. Retry after some time if this error persists.
```

API locking is a robust feature that empowers us to proactively secure and optimize access to our APIs. Our API locks objects on some operations to prevent the disruption caused by concurrent workloads that could potentially lead to inconsistent outcomes.

This proactive measure not only ensures the continued integrity and performance of our APIs but also guarantees a high standard of security for our users. Once triggered, the API lock initiates a controlled pause in access, preventing any potential threats from compromising the system.






# Go-live Checklist

Refer to this checklist for a seamless transition as you prepare to go live with your integration.

<Warning>
  The connector configurations set up in the sandbox need to be replicated on the Hyperswitch production account.
</Warning>

### Signing of Hyperswitch services agreement

* [ ] Ensure that the Hyperswitch services agreement is signed and shared with the Hyperswitch team. In case you need any help, please drop an email to [biz@hyperswitch.io](mailto:biz@hyperswitch.io).

<Warning>
  The Hyperswitch team will share your production Hyperswitch credentials once the above process is completed.
</Warning>

### Connector Configurations

* [ ] Configure all the required connectors using production credentials on the Hyperswitch production dashboard and enable the required payment methods.
* [ ] Ensure that the payment methods are enabled on the connector (payment processor) dashboard.
* [ ] Enable raw card processing for each connector. Some connectors offer this as a dashboard toggle feature. Some processors might need you to share a PCI Attestation of Compliance over email to enable this. Drop an email to [biz@hyperswitch.io](mailto:biz@hyperswitch.io) if you need any support with PCI AOC.

### Secure your api-keys

* [ ] Make sure your secret key (api-key) is not exposed on the front-end (website/mobile app).
* [ ] Ensure that your workflow avoids the duplication or storage of your API keys in multiple locations.

### Set up Webhooks

* [ ] [Configure your webhook endpoint](https://juspay-78.mintlify.app/essentials/webhooks#configuring-webhooks) on our dashboard to receive notifications for different events.
* [ ] Update Hyperswitch's webhook endpoints on your connector's Dashboard. [Refer here](https://juspay-78.mintlify.app/essentials/webhooks#configuring-webhooks) for detailed instructions.
* [ ] Update the connector secret key in our dashboard for us to authenticate webhooks sent by your connector.

### Secure your Payments

* [ ] Make sure you decrypt and verify the signed payload sent along with the payment status in your return URL.
* [ ] Always verify the payment amount and payment status before fulfilling your customer's shopping cart/service request.

### Error Handling

* [ ] Make sure your API integration is set up to handle all the possible error scenarios (refer this [link](https://juspay-78.mintlify.app/essentials/error_codes)).
* [ ] Ensure your Unified Checkout (SDK) integration is set up to handle all the possible error scenarios (refer this [link](https://hyperswitch.io/docs/sdkIntegrations/unifiedCheckoutWeb/errorCodes)).
* [ ] Ensure that your integration can handle the entire payments lifecycle and test various scenarios using actual payment details.

### Customize and sanity check the payment experience

* [ ] Ensure the pay button is properly highlighted to the customer.
* [ ] Ensure a blended look and feel of the payment experience using the [styling APIs](https://hyperswitch.io/docs/sdkIntegrations/unifiedCheckoutWeb/customization) of Unified Checkout.

Hyperswitch provides flexible payment processing with multiple flow patterns to accommodate different business needs. The system supports one-time payments, saved payment methods, and recurring billing through a comprehensive API design.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["Payment Request"] --> B{"Payment Type"}
    B -->|One-time| C["One-time Payment Flows"]
    B -->|Save for Future| D["Payment Method Storage"]
    B -->|Recurring| E["Recurring Payment Flows"]
    
    C --> C1["Instant Payment"]

    D --> D2["List Saved Methods"]
    
    E --> E1["Setup (CIT)"]
    E --> E2["Execute (MIT)"]
```

## One-Time Payment Patterns

### 1. Instant Payment (Automatic Capture)

**Use Case:** Simple, immediate payment processing

**Endpoint:**
`POST /payments`

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Hyperswitch
    participant Processor
    
    Client->>Hyperswitch: POST /payments<br/>{confirm: true, capture_method: "automatic"}
    Hyperswitch->>Processor: Authorize + Capture
    Processor-->>Hyperswitch: Payment Complete
    Hyperswitch-->>Client: Status: succeeded
```

**Required Fields:**

* `confirm: true`
* `capture_method: "automatic"`
* `payment_method`

**Final Status:** `succeeded`

### 2. Two-Step Manual Capture

**Use Case:** Deferred settlement (e.g., ship before charging)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Hyperswitch
    participant Processor
    
    Client->>Hyperswitch: POST /payments<br/>{confirm: true, capture_method: "manual"}
    Hyperswitch->>Processor: Authorize Only
    Processor-->>Hyperswitch: Authorization Hold
    Hyperswitch-->>Client: Status: requires_capture
    
    Note over Client: Ship goods, then capture
    
    Client->>Hyperswitch: POST /payments/{id}/capture
    Hyperswitch->>Processor: Capture Funds
    Processor-->>Hyperswitch: Capture Complete
    Hyperswitch-->>Client: Status: succeeded
```

**Flow:**

1. **Authorize:** `POST /payments` with `capture_method: "manual"`
2. **Status:** `requires_capture`
3. **Capture:** `POST /payments/{payment_id}/capture`
4. **Final Status:** `succeeded`

### 3. Fully Decoupled Flow

**Use Case:** Complex checkout journeys with multiple modification steps. Useful in headless checkout or B2B portals where data is filled progressively.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Hyperswitch
    
    Client->>Hyperswitch: POST /payments<br/>(Create Intent)
    Hyperswitch-->>Client: payment_id + client_secret
    
    Client->>Hyperswitch: POST /payments/{id}<br/>(Update: customer, amount, etc.)
    Hyperswitch-->>Client: Updated Intent
    
    Client->>Hyperswitch: POST /payments/{id}/confirm<br/>(Final Confirmation)
    Hyperswitch-->>Client: Status: succeeded/requires_capture
    
    opt Manual Capture
        Client->>Hyperswitch: POST /payments/{id}/capture
        Hyperswitch-->>Client: Status: succeeded
    end
```

**Endpoints:**

* **Create:**
  `POST /payments`
* **Update:**
  `POST /payments/{payment_id}`
* **Confirm:**
  `POST /payments/{payment_id}/confirm`
* **Capture:**
  `POST /payments/{payment_id}/capture` (if manual)

### 4. 3D Secure Authentication Flow

**Use Case:** Enhanced security with customer authentication

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Hyperswitch
    participant Customer
    participant Bank
    
    Client->>Hyperswitch: POST /payments<br/>{authentication_type: "three_ds"}
    Hyperswitch-->>Client: Status: requires_customer_action<br/>+ redirect_url
    
    Client->>Customer: Redirect to 3DS page
    Customer->>Bank: Complete 3DS Challenge
    Bank-->>Hyperswitch: Authentication Result
    Hyperswitch->>Hyperswitch: Resume Payment Processing
    Hyperswitch-->>Client: Status: succeeded
```

**Additional Fields:**

* `authentication_type: "three_ds"`

**Status Progression:** `processing` ‚Üí `requires_customer_action` ‚Üí `succeeded`

## Payment Method Management

### 1. Saving Payment Methods

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["Payment Request"] --> B["Add setup_future_usage"]
    B --> C{"Usage Type"}
    C -->|"off_session"| D["For Recurring/MIT"]
    C -->|"on_session"| E["For Customer-Present"]
    D --> F["payment_method_id Returned"]
    E --> F
```

**During Payment Creation:**

* Add `setup_future_usage: "off_session"` or `"on_session"`
* Include `customer_id`
* **Result:** `payment_method_id` returned on success

**Understanding `setup_future_usage`:**

* **`on_session`**: Use when the customer is actively present during the transaction. This is typical for scenarios like saving card details for faster checkouts in subsequent sessions where the customer will still be present to initiate the payment (e.g., card vaulting for e-commerce sites).
* **`off_session`**: Use when you intend to charge the customer later without their active involvement at the time of charge. This is suitable for subscriptions, recurring billing, or merchant-initiated transactions (MITs) where the customer has pre-authorized future charges.

### 2. Using Saved Payment Methods

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Hyperswitch
    
    Client->>Hyperswitch: POST /payments/create<br/>{customer_id}
    Hyperswitch-->>Client: client_secret
    
    Client->>Hyperswitch: GET /customers/payment_methods<br/>{client_secret, publishable_key}
    Hyperswitch-->>Client: List of payment_tokens
    
    Client->>Hyperswitch: POST /payments/{id}/confirm<br/>{payment_token}
    Hyperswitch-->>Client: Payment Result
```

**Steps:**

1. **Initiate:** Create payment with `customer_id`
2. **List:** Get saved cards via `GET /customers/payment_methods`
3. **Confirm:** Use selected `payment_token` in confirm call

### PCI Compliance and `payment_method_id`

Storing `payment_method_id` (which is a token representing the actual payment instrument, which could be a payment token, network token, or payment processor token) significantly reduces your PCI DSS scope. Hyperswitch securely stores the sensitive card details and provides you with this token. While you still need to ensure your systems handle `payment_method_id` and related customer data securely, you avoid the complexities of storing raw card numbers. Always consult with a PCI QSA to understand your specific compliance obligations.

## Recurring Payment Flows

### 3. Customer-Initiated Transaction (CIT) Setup

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["CIT Setup"] --> B{"Setup Type"}
    B -->|"With Charge"| C["Amount > 0<br/>setup_future_usage: off_session"]
    B -->|"Zero Dollar Auth"| D["Amount: 0<br/>payment_type: setup_mandate"]
    C --> E["payment_method_id"]
    D --> E
```

**Option 1 - Setup with Charge:**

* `setup_future_usage: "off_session"`
* `amount > 0`

**Option 2 - Zero Dollar Authorization:**

* `setup_future_usage: "off_session"`
* `amount: 0`
* `payment_type: "setup_mandate"`

### 4. Merchant-Initiated Transaction (MIT) Execution

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Merchant
    participant Hyperswitch
    participant Processor
    
    Note over Merchant: Subscription billing trigger
    
    Merchant->>Hyperswitch: POST /payments<br/>{off_session: true, recurring_details}
    Hyperswitch->>Processor: Process with saved payment_method_id
    Processor-->>Hyperswitch: Payment Result
    Hyperswitch-->>Merchant: Status: succeeded
```

**Required Fields:**

* `off_session: true`
* `recurring_details: {
        "type": "payment_method_id",
        "data": "<from_setup>"}`

**Use Case:** Subscription charges, scheduled billing without customer interaction

## Status Flow Summary

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> RequiresConfirmation
    RequiresConfirmation --> Processing: confirm=true
    Processing --> RequiresCustomerAction: 3DS needed
    RequiresCustomerAction --> Processing: 3DS complete
    Processing --> RequiresCapture: manual capture
    Processing --> Succeeded: automatic capture
    RequiresCapture --> Succeeded: capture API call
    RequiresCapture --> PartiallyCaptured: partial capture
    PartiallyCaptured --> [*]
    Succeeded --> [*]
    Processing --> Failed: payment failed
    Failed --> [*]
```

## Notes

* **Terminal States:** `succeeded`, `failed`, `cancelled`, `partially_captured` are terminal states requiring no further action
* **Capture Methods:** System supports `automatic` (funds captured immediately), `manual` (funds captured in a separate step), `manual_multiple` (funds captured in multiple partial amounts via separate steps), and `scheduled` (funds captured automatically at a future predefined time) capture methods.
* **Authentication:** 3DS authentication automatically resumes payment processing after customer completion
* **MIT Compliance:** Off-session recurring payments follow industry standards for merchant-initiated transactions
